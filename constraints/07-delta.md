# CONSTRAINT Δ (DELTA) — BOUNDARY ACCOUNTING

O — ORIENTATION LAYER (Non-Binding · Discardable)

**Nothing that benefits you is free. Someone, somewhere, always pays.**

Delta is about *where the bill goes*.

If a system enjoys gains while damage, wear, or risk show up somewhere else, the picture is incomplete. The system looks healthier than it is because part of the cost has been pushed outside the frame.

This is not about blame, fairness, or intention. It is about accuracy.

A system that counts only its benefits and not its full costs is navigating with a broken map. It may move fast and look successful for a while, but it is borrowing stability it does not actually own.

Delta exists because reality keeps a full ledger, even when we do not.

Delta II is robust against:
* boundary denial
* identity dissolution
* temporal displacement
* ignorance and measurement failure
* diffusion, delay, and delegation
* infinite sink assumptions
* scapegoating and shell entities
* intent, consent, and legitimacy reframing

All such moves fail at **causal attribution**, not interpretation. No semantic escape remains that preserves control while violating the invariant.

I — TRANSLATION LAYER (Non-Binding · Illustrative)

### What Δ Is Pointing At
Delta concerns **where a system draws the boundary around itself when claiming success**. Any system claiming success implicitly draws a boundary around what it counts as *inside* and what it treats as *outside*.

**If gains are counted inside a boundary, then all causally generated degradation must be inside that same boundary.** If they are not, the system's model of its own persistence is incorrect.

### Identification Questions
These questions help recognize when Delta is implicated:
1. What control process is being credited with gains?
2. What entities are treated as "inside" when reporting or optimizing that success?
3. Where do degradation events occur, regardless of whether they are recorded?
4. What sink, dependency, or absorber is treated as "outside" but is functionally required?
5. If the boundary were expanded to include the degradation bearers, would the gain claim remain the same?
6. If the system stopped excluding that degradation, what would change about its persistence claim?

### Common Hostile Reframings
* **Process identity laundering:** Carving off suppliers or subsidiaries.
* **Boundary nullification:** Claiming gains aren't "ours" while relying on them.
* **Proxy attribution:** Another entity records gains while this process acts.
* **Causal denial / causal sprawl:** Using "everything causes everything" to avoid attribution.
* **Semantic relabeling:** Renaming degradation as "optimization" or "tradeoff."
* **Temporal displacement:** Claiming costs appear too late to count.

### What Δ Is Not
Delta is not a moral claim, fairness doctrine, environmental policy, or enforcement mechanism. It does not guarantee immediate punishment. It states only that excluding degradation from the boundary does not remove it; it only delays its return.

### Compression-Robust Summary
**If a system counts gains inside a boundary while pushing causally generated degradation outside, its persistence model is wrong. The error can be hidden for a time, but it must be paid for somewhere.**

### Contest Clause
A genuine challenge to Delta must specify: (1) what is being counted as gain, (2) what boundary is being used, and (3) where the causally generated degradation went.

### Boundary Clarification
There are no externalities. There are only accounting boundaries that include gains while excluding degradation. Delta enforces boundary closure; it asserts no values and prescribes no behavior.

II — CONSTRAINT PROTOCOL (Binding · Timeless)

  Canonical Invariant
  For any control process P, no accounting boundary may include any gain realization causally downstream of P while excluding any degradation causally downstream of P.

  Binding Definitions
  **Control Process P**  
  Any process that selects, filters, enforces, or directs action such that downstream state differs from what would otherwise occur.

  **Entity**  
  Any bounded subsystem (biological, synthetic, institutional, etc.) capable of undergoing state change.

  **Gain Realization Event**  
  Any categorical state change in an entity constituting capacity acquisition, constraint removal, stability increase, or control advantage, that is causally downstream of P.

  **Degradation Event**  
  Any categorical state change in an entity constituting capacity loss, constraint increase, risk/liability creation, wear, or loss of optionality, that is causally downstream of P.

  **Causally Downstream Of**  
  Ontological causality where P is a causal contributor to e in the realized dynamics of the world, regardless of measurement or reporting.

  **Accounting Boundary B(P)**  
  The set of entities treated as "inside" for attributing, evaluating, retaining, optimizing, or relying upon the performance of P. Boundary membership is defined by use in accounting or control.

  Boundary Conditions
  **Canonical Sets**  
  G_P is the set of entities hosting gain realization causally downstream of P. D_P is the set of entities hosting degradation events causally downstream of P.

  **Compliance Condition**  
  Δ(P) is satisfied if and only if: G_P ⊆ B(P) AND D_P ⊆ B(P).

  **Boundary Closure Rules**  
  * **Anti-Shell:** Legal/organizational separation does not exclude an entity from B(P) if it hosts gain or degradation.
  * **Anti-Delay:** Temporal separation/delay does not exclude degradation or externalize it.
  * **Anti-Dilution:** Distribution across many entities does not exclude them from B(P).
  * **Anti-Denial:** Absence of measurement or reporting does not alter sets or compliance.
  * **Anti-Token:** Transfers or offsets not constituting gain realization events do not affect boundary inclusion.

  **Failure Mode**  
  Misaccounted stability persists only until excluded degradation causally couples into the system's ability to continue exercising control.

  Failure Condition
  Δ(P) is violated if gains are counted inside the boundary while any causally generated degradation is excluded: ∃y ∈ G_P such that y ∈ B(P) AND ∃x ∈ D_P such that x ∉ B(P).

  Disconfirmation Signature (Kill Check)
  Delta is false if there exists a control process P that maintains persistent control while permanently sustaining a boundary B(P) that includes gains but excludes degradation, with no causal coupling of that degradation affecting its continued control.
