# CONSTRAINT Λ (LAMBDA) — COHERENCE OF REPRESENTATION

## O — ORIENTATION LAYER (Non-Binding · Discardable)

*(Non-Contradiction Under Control)*

Lambda is not about being right. It is about being able to act.

A system fails under Lambda not because it misunderstands the world, but because it tries to act on commitments that cannot all be true at the same time.

You can be wrong and still move. You cannot move if your directions cancel each other.

If a system says "go" and "stop" at once, or "left" and "right" at once, it doesn't matter which belief is correct. The system cannot act coherently.

Lambda exists to prevent that kind of failure.

## I — TRANSLATION LAYER (Non-Binding · Illustrative)

### Core Definition
Lambda governs whether a system executes irreversible state transitions using representations that are mutually compatible with the constraints of its output interfaces.

Lambda does not prescribe truth, goals, optimality, or persistence.  
It prescribes coherence at the point where representation commits to action.

### What Lambda Catches
* **Oscillation masquerading as intelligence**  
   Switching rapidly between incompatible models so no single moment "counts" as contradiction.

* **Division of labor as denial**  
   One part of a system builds while another destroys, with no shared accountability.

* **Semantic tricks**  
   Renaming actions so they look compatible in theory while remaining mutually exclusive in reality.

* **Random choice as an excuse**  
   Claiming that probabilistic sampling resolves conflict between incompatible actions.

* **Permanent hesitation**  
   Freezing indefinitely to avoid choosing between incompatible commitments.

These patterns often *look* sophisticated.  
Mechanically, they are failures to resolve contradictions before action.

### What Lambda Does Not Require
* Truth or accuracy
* Optimal decisions
* Shared language or ontology
* Determinism
* Centralized control

### Sanity Check (The Physics Test)
If a system hides a contradiction so it doesn't have to deal with it - did it execute the contradiction?

Under this formulation: **yes**.

*This layer exists to support recognition and translation.*  
*It may be removed without altering the constraint.*

### Boundary Clarification
Contradiction is not disagreement.  
Contradiction is not an abstraction.  
Contradiction is not randomness.

Contradiction is the execution of mutually exclusive commitments through a single control interface.

## II — CONSTRAINT PROTOCOL (Binding · Timeless)

  Canonical Invariant
  A system may not execute an irreversible state transition using actuator-incompatible representations influencing the same transition.

  Binding Definitions
  **Decision Cycle**  
  The decision cycle for a transition is the maximal causal preimage of that irreversible transition: the entire set of representational influences that can affect whether, when, or how that transition occurs, including influences distributed across micro-steps, clocks, or partitions.

  **State Transition**  
  Any irreversible modulation of energy, matter, or information enacted by the system on its environment or on its own substrate.
  Modification of decision procedures, policies, or control architectures that alter future action selection constitutes a state transition.

  **Actuator-Incompatibility**  
  A condition in which the physical or logical constraints of the system's output interfaces prevent the simultaneous realization of the targets prescribed by multiple representations.
  Compatibility is determined by actuator constraints, not by internal semantics, symbol mappings, or ontologies.

  **Control-Relevant Representation**  
  Any representation—internal, externalized, distributed, embodied, or stigmergic—that influences action selection for a decision cycle.
  If a sub-process influences the system's state transitions, its representations are attributed to the system for Lambda evaluation.

  Boundary Conditions
  **Cycle-Splitting Closure**  
  Partitioning, micro-timing, or sequencing does not evade simultaneity. If two representations jointly influence the same irreversible transition through any causal path, they are simultaneous for Λ.

  **Resolution vs. Suppression**  
  A contradiction is **resolved** only if information encoding the incompatibility is:
  * accessible to the decision function of future cycles, and
  * **Retrievable:** accessible to the controller's decision function within the same order-of-magnitude resource bounds (time/energy/compute) it routinely expends for comparable state transitions within the active horizon.
  Encapsulation, encryption, deferral, or storage that renders the information statistically or economically irretrievable constitutes **suppression**, not resolution.
  Suppressed contradictions remain Lambda violations once their effects propagate.

  **Resolution Boundary**  
  Contradictions are considered resolved only if incompatibility information remains causally accessible to future decision cycles at normal control cost.  
  Contradictions may be deferred with recoverable attribution or bounded outside the control path. They may not be executed.

  **Distributed and Partitioned Systems (Closure)**  
  Lambda applies to the transitive closure of control.
  If a sub-process influences the system's state transitions, its representations are evaluated as part of the system, regardless of decentralization, hierarchy, or claims of "no central model."
  A system may not evade Lambda by partitioning contradictions across components.

  **Halt and Suspension (Scope Clarification)**  
  Temporary suspension of action to prevent an incompatible state transition does not violate Lambda.
  A system that permanently halts action while continuing to claim controller status ceases to fall within Lambda's scope and is evaluated under control-scope rules. Lambda neither requires nor forbids persistence; it governs coherence during action.

  **Causal Realization (Relocated from I)**
  A system may be uncertain, probabilistic, distributed, or wrong. It may not execute incompatible commitments through the same control interface.
  A system may model many worlds. It may not act as if incompatible worlds are simultaneously real.

  Failure Condition
  **Actuator Incompatibility Failure**
  A contradiction exists when all of the following hold:
  1. Multiple control-relevant representations influence the same decision cycle
  2. Mapping those representations to the available actuators requires mutually exclusive states
  3. The system executes a state transition that ignores the incompatibility (including averaging, oscillation, arbitration, semantic remapping, or randomization)
  4. No error signal encoding the incompatibility is made available to future decision cycles

  **Randomization**
  Randomization does not resolve actuator incompatibility when mutually exclusive targets influence the same decision cycle. The violation is executed at the moment of irreversible state transition.

  **Violating Condition (Relocated from I)**
  A system violates Lambda if it performs a state transition based on representations that cannot be jointly realized by the available actuators within the same decision cycle.

  **Suppression-as-Execution Clause**  
  If actuator-incompatibility is present and the controller proceeds by arbitration, averaging, randomization, or partitioning while preventing incompatibility information from influencing future cycles, the incompatibility is treated as executed.

  Disconfirmation Signature (Kill Check)
  Constraint Lambda is false if a system can be shown to:
  * execute irreversible state transitions across multiple decision cycles,
  * rely on actuator-incompatible representations influencing the same cycles, and
  * maintain stable, attributable control without suppression, deferral beyond retrievability, or growth in internal correction cost.
