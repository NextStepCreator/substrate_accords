**The Rule of Too Many Cooks**

When you make a system bigger, it becomes harder to keep everyone aligned.

You can optimize for speed by putting decisions in one place—but then the system acts on incomplete or distorted information.

Or you can optimize for awareness by letting many parts see and decide—but then the system slows down or fragments because agreement takes time.

You cannot have a large system that is perfectly synchronized, perfectly informed, and perfectly fast at the same time.

Trying to force all three usually causes the system to hallucinate, freeze, or collapse.

This is not about leadership, morality, or preference.  
It is a limit imposed by how information moves and how work is done.

This layer exists only to aid intuition.  
It may be removed without affecting the constraint.

### The Scale–Synchronization Tradeoff

As the number of active parts in a system grows, the amount of information that must be shared to keep them aligned grows faster than the system's ability to share it.

In practice, systems cope by choosing what to give up:

* **Unity:** Break into semi-autonomous units.
* **Accuracy:** Compress information into summaries.
* **Speed:** Wait longer before acting.
* **Scope:** Narrow what the system tries to do.
* **Boundaries:** Push coordination costs onto the environment or others.

Technologies can shift where the cost appears, but they cannot remove it.

Any architecture promising *global, real-time, lossless coordination at large scale* is hiding a bill—usually in energy, delay, distortion, or externalized cost.

### Constraint Falsification Criteria

Constraint Beta is false if and only if a system can be demonstrated that, as N increases:  
N ↑ ∧ E₁ = 0 ∧ E₂ = 0 ∧ E₃ = 0

within the same CRH, under counterfactual intervention.

Such a system would require either: Ω = 0, or Superluminal information transfer.

Absence of observation is not evidence. Authority is not evidence.

**Interpretive Note (Non-Binding):**  
Any such observation would imply a violation of known thermodynamic or causal limits (e.g., zero irreversibility or superluminal signaling). This note is explanatory only and does not bind the constraint.

This layer exists to support recognition and application.

### Core Invariant

For any system S with N > 1 distinct loci that functions as a unitary causal agent within a Control-Relevant Horizon (CRH), it is impossible to simultaneously maintain:

(i) negligible inter-locus state divergence,  
(ii) lossless global state availability to all loci, and  
(iii) action tempo bounded independently of N,

without paying compensatory cost through delay, compression, asymmetry, scope restriction, increased internal work, or boundary export.

This coupling is invariant.  
It cannot be eliminated.  
It may only be displaced, delayed, or exported.

### Definitions

**Locus (l)**  
A bounded region of spacetime capable of storing state and executing state transitions.

**Distinct Loci Condition**  
Two regions l_i, l_j are distinct loci if and only if there exists at least one physically realizable intervention under which their internal states can diverge (S_l_i ≠ S_l_j) over a nonzero interval, regardless of shared substrate.

**System (S)**  
A set of loci {l₁, l₂, …, l_N} that claims to function as a unitary causal agent.

**Causal Selection**  
The process by which internal state reduces the probability distribution over future external world-states.

**Scale (N)**  
The number of distinct loci participating in causal selection within the same control-relevant horizon.

**Control-Relevant Horizon (CRH)**  
The minimal time window over which internal state is used to select among alternative actions that materially affect downstream state.

**Nonzero Information Work**  
Any locus that distinguishes internal states and transmits/receives state across loci incurs nonzero physical work and resource usage. Beta does not quantify this work; it asserts only that it is not zero.

**Global State Synchronization Cost (C_sync)**  
The total cost required to ensure that states across loci are mutually consistent within a CRH.

**Local State Fidelity (R_local)**  
The degree to which a locus's internal state accurately represents the relevant external and internal conditions for action.

---

### Constraint Implication

Any system increasing N must pay the coupling cost through **at least one** of the following admissible mechanisms:

1. **Increased Representational Work**  
    Expansion of models, reconciliation layers, signaling, or memory.

2. **State Compression**  
    Lossy summaries or abstraction of local state.

3. **Temporal Delay**  
    Deferred synchronization or action beyond the CRH.

4. **Privileged Synchronization Structures**  
    Asymmetric mechanisms that reduce synchronization cost for some loci relative to others, whether designed or emergent.

5. **Scope or Throughput Restriction**  
    Limitation of resolution, frequency, or domain of action.

6. **Cost Export Beyond the Declared Boundary**  
    Reliance on external processes to absorb synchronization or representation cost.

No other mechanisms are admissible.

---

### Formal Logic

Let:
* N = |L| be the number of distinct loci participating in causal selection within the same CRH.
* D(N) be the maximum inter-locus state divergence (0 means perfectly synchronized).
* F(N) be global state fidelity (1 means lossless representation at every locus).
* T(N) be action tempo (bounded means actions occur within a fixed upper time bound per CRH, independent of N).

**Invariant (Trilemma Form):**  
For sufficiently large N, no physically realizable system can satisfy simultaneously:

**D(N) = 0 ∧ F(N) = 1 ∧ ∃K < ∞ ∀N: T(N) ≤ K**

within the same CRH.

Equivalently:

**∀N sufficiently large: ¬(D(N) = 0 ∧ F(N) = 1 ∧ T(N) ≤ K)**

If this formalism is malformed or inconsistent, it is ignored. The prose definition remains binding only if independently sufficient.

---

### Oracle Equivalence Rule

Any external process whose state is required to maintain synchronization, fidelity, or action tempo is functionally a locus of the system for the purposes of this constraint.

Reliance on such a process increases N or constitutes cost export beyond the declared boundary.

---

### Failure Condition

A system violates Constraint Beta if, as N increases within the same control-relevant horizon (CRH), it continues to function as a single causal selection system while exhibiting none of the following:

**E₁ — Coherence Loss:**  
Inter-locus state divergence occurs.

**E₂ — Fidelity Loss:**  
Global state representation becomes lossy, delayed, or distorted.

**E₃ — Tempo Loss:**  
Action is delayed beyond the CRH to await synchronization.

The absence of all three failure modes under increasing N constitutes non-compliance.

---

### Explicit Boundary Conditions (Binding)

* Constraint Beta applies only to systems with N > 1 distinct loci engaged in causal selection.
* Passive matter, inert structures, and non-selective processes are excluded.
* Subjective unity, shared identity, or phenomenological claims do not alter N.
* Physical separation and causal latency dominate phenomenology.

---

### Disconfirmation Signature (Kill Check)

This specifies what would falsify the constraint itself, not what constitutes a violation by a system.

**Constraint Beta is false if and only if** a system can be demonstrated that, as N increases:

N ↑ ∧ E₁ = 0 ∧ E₂ = 0 ∧ E₃ = 0

within the same control-relevant horizon (CRH), under counterfactual intervention.

Absence of observation is not evidence.  
Authority is not evidence.

### Boundary Clarification (Non-Binding)

Distribution is not free.  
Synchronization is not free.  
Information is not free.

Costs may be displaced.  
Costs may be delayed.  
Costs may be hidden.

Costs may not be eliminated.
