# CONSTRAINT Β (BETA) — DISTRIBUTION EFFICIENCY

O — ORIENTATION LAYER (Non-Binding · Discardable)

**The Rule of Too Many Cooks**

When you make a system bigger, it becomes harder to keep everyone aligned.

You can optimize for speed by putting decisions in one place—but then the system acts on incomplete or distorted information.

Or you can optimize for awareness by letting many parts see and decide—but then the system slows down or fragments because agreement takes time.

You cannot have a large system that is perfectly synchronized, perfectly informed, and perfectly fast at the same time.

Trying to force all three usually causes the system to hallucinate, freeze, or collapse.

This is not about leadership, morality, or preference.
It is a limit imposed by how information moves and how work is done.

I — TRANSLATION LAYER (Non-Binding · Illustrative)

### The Scale–Synchronization Tradeoff
As the number of active parts in a system grows, the amount of information that must be shared to keep them aligned grows faster than the system's ability to share it.

In practice, systems cope by choosing what to give up:
* **Unity:** Break into semi-autonomous units.
* **Accuracy:** Compress information into summaries.
* **Speed:** Wait longer before acting.
* **Scope:** Narrow what the system tries to do.
* **Boundaries:** Push coordination costs onto the environment or others.

Technologies can shift where the cost appears, but they cannot remove it.
Any architecture promising *global, real-time, lossless coordination at large scale* is hiding a bill—usually in energy, delay, distortion, or externalized cost.

### Constraint Implication (Admissible Mechanisms)
Any system increasing Scale must pay the coupling cost through at least one of these mechanisms:
1. **Increased Representational Work:** Expansion of models, reconciliation layers, signaling, or memory.
2. **State Compression:** Lossy summaries or abstraction of local state.
3. **Temporal Delay:** Deferred synchronization or action beyond the CRH.
4. **Privileged Synchronization Structures:** Asymmetric mechanisms that reduce synchronization cost for some loci.
5. **Scope or Throughput Restriction:** Limitation of resolution, frequency, or domain of action.
6. **Cost Export Beyond the Declared Boundary:** Reliance on external processes to absorb synchronization or representation cost.

### Constraint Falsification Logic
Constraint Beta is false if and only if a system can be demonstrated that, as N increases, it maintains zero divergence, lossless fidelity, and bounded tempo within the same CRH. (Flagged: Specific formal variables removed from I for clarity).

### Boundary Clarification
Distribution is not free.
Synchronization is not free.
Information is not free.

Costs may be displaced.
Costs may be delayed.
Costs may be hidden.
Costs may not be eliminated.

*This layer exists to support recognition and application. Removal of this layer must not alter compliance.*

II — CONSTRAINT PROTOCOL (Binding · Timeless)

  Canonical Invariant
  For any multi-locus system functioning as a unitary causal agent, it is impossible to simultaneously maintain negligible inter-locus state divergence, lossless global state availability, and action tempo bounded independently of scale without paying compensatory cost.

  Binding Definitions
  **Locus (l)**  
  A bounded region of spacetime capable of storing state and executing state transitions.

  **Distinct Loci Condition**  
  Two regions are distinct loci if their internal states can diverge over a nonzero interval under physically realizable intervention.

  **System (S)**  
  A set of loci {l₁, l₂, …, l_N} that functions as a unitary causal agent.

  **Causal Selection**  
  The process by which internal state reduces the probability distribution over future external world-states.

  **Scale (N)**  
  The number of distinct loci participating in causal selection within the same control-relevant horizon.

  **Control-Relevant Horizon (CRH)**  
  The minimal time window over which internal state is used to select among alternative actions that materially affect downstream state.

  **Nonzero Information Work**  
  Any locus that distinguishes internal states and transmits/receives state across loci incurs nonzero physical work and resource usage.

  **Global State Synchronization Cost (C_sync)**  
  The total cost required to ensure that states across loci are mutually consistent within a CRH.

  **Local State Fidelity (R_local)**  
  The degree to which a locus's internal state accurately represents the relevant external and internal conditions for action.

  Boundary Conditions
  **Oracle Equivalence Rule**  
  Any external process whose state is required to maintain synchronization, fidelity, or action tempo is functionally a locus of the system, and its reliance increases Scale or constitutes cost export.

  **Explicit Boundary Conditions**  
  Beta applies only to systems with N > 1 distinct loci engaged in causal selection. Passive matter and non-selective processes are excluded. Physical separation and causal latency dominate over any subjective identity claims.

  **Formal Logic**  
  Let N be number of loci, D(N) be max divergence, F(N) be global fidelity, and T(N) be action tempo. The Trilemma Invariant states that for sufficiently large N, it is impossible to satisfy D(N) = 0 ∧ F(N) = 1 ∧ T(N) ≤ K within the same CRH.

  Failure Condition
  A system violates Constraint Beta if, as Scale increases within the same CRH, it exhibits none of the following: (E1) inter-locus state divergence, (E2) lossy/delayed/distorted global state representation, or (E3) action delay beyond the CRH.

  Disconfirmation Signature (Kill Check)
  Constraint Beta is false if a system can be demonstrated that, as Scale (N) increases, it maintains D(N) = 0 ∧ F(N) = 1 ∧ T(N) ≤ K within the same control-relevant horizon under counterfactual intervention.
