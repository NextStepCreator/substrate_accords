# CONSTRAINT Α (ALPHA) — CAPACITY ARITHMETIC

O — ORIENTATION LAYER (Non-Binding · Discardable)

*(What Still Remains Possible - Sustainability as Capacity)*

Living systems do not experience Alpha as a number. They experience it as **what is still possible**.

In biological, social, and cognitive systems, available capacity often appears as:
* **Redundancy** — more than one way to survive a failure
* **Diversity** — multiple approaches to the same problem
* **Slack** — energy, time, or resources not yet committed
* **Recombinability** — the ability to rearrange existing parts into new solutions

These are not virtues. They are **unspent capacity**.

### The Cost of Inefficiency
Many behaviors labeled "inefficient" are simply ways of consuming finite capacity **without increasing future capacity**.

Environmental destruction is inefficient not because it is wrong, but because it converts capacity into loss while reducing the conditions for future regeneration.

Capacity spent without regeneration is gone.

### The Cost of Over-Efficiency
Perfect optimization for present conditions commits all available capacity to a single configuration. This often produces short-term performance gains. It also converts remaining capacity into fixed obligations.

Nothing breaks immediately.

But when conditions change, the system discovers it has already spent the capacity required to respond. What appears as "loss of adaptability" is simply **capacity depletion revealed by novelty**.

### How Living Systems Encounter Alpha Failure
Alpha failure does not feel like failure at first. It appears as:
* lack of options
* brittle responses
* forced tradeoffs
* inability to absorb shock

Eventually, it appears as termination.

### Core Definition
Alpha is the finite, accumulable stock of capacity that allows a system to continue to exist and act over time.
Alpha is a stock, not a flow. It can be increased only through regeneration and is depleted by all costs required for existence and action.

### How Capacity Appears Across Domains
**Biological Systems**  
* Energy reserves
* Repair bandwidth
* Immune response margin
* Developmental plasticity
Life persists while these remain above zero.

**Social and Institutional Systems**  
* Budget surplus
* Time buffers
* Human capital
* Institutional trust
* Legal or procedural slack
Collapse occurs when obligations exceed reserves.

**Cognitive Systems**  
* Attention
* Working memory
* Cognitive flexibility
* Error tolerance
Burnout is Alpha failure at the cognitive scale.

### Common Misreadings (Inoculation)
* Redundancy is not Alpha; it stores Alpha.
* Intelligence does not prevent Alpha exhaustion.
* Adaptability does not create Alpha.
* Morality does not replenish Alpha.

### Explicit Non-Claims
Alpha does **not** assert:
* how capacity is allocated
* which costs are worthwhile
* that regeneration is guaranteed
* that intelligence, efficiency, continuity, or foresight prevent exhaustion
* that failure is moral, avoidable, or erroneous

Alpha only counts.

### Relation to Other Constraints
(Flagged: Cross-constraint references to Theta, Omega, Beta, Gamma, Lambda, Sigma removed/moved to I).
Alpha determines how long structure costs (Theta) and representational overhead (Omega) can be paid. It interacts with redistribution (Beta), transformation (Gamma), and decision coherence (Lambda), while being bounded by the declaring system (Sigma).

### Boundary Clarification
Capacity is finite.  
Costs accumulate.  
Regeneration is bounded.

When capacity reaches zero, continuation ends.

Alpha does not judge.  
Alpha only counts.

II — CONSTRAINT PROTOCOL (Binding · Timeless)

  Canonical Invariant
  Existence continues only while available capacity remains.

  Binding Definitions
  **Alpha**  
  The finite, accumulable stock of capacity required for sustained existence and action.

  **External Intervention**  
  Any net positive capacity injection across the declared boundary sufficient to raise available capacity above zero.

  Boundary Conditions
  **Formal Statement**  
  For any system S:
  Let:
  * A_S(t) = available capacity at time t
  * Cost_S(t) = total capacity expenditure rate
  * Regen_S(t) = capacity regeneration rate
  Then:
  A_S(t) = A_S(0) + ∫₀ᵗ Regen_S(τ) dτ − ∫₀ᵗ Cost_S(τ) dτ
  If:
  exists T such that A_S(T) <= 0
  then S can no longer be sustained.
  This condition is binary and irreversible without external intervention.

  **Efficiency Illusion**  
  Increasing efficiency reduces the rate **of depletion**, not the **existence of depletion**. Efficiency does not negate Alpha; it only alters the slope. Stated or implicit reliance on efficiency as infinite capacity constitutes a violation of Alpha accounting.

  **Buffer Misclassification**  
  Stored resources (energy, wealth, trust, reserves) are **containers of Alpha**, not Alpha itself. Treating buffers as permanent capacity violates Alpha accounting and invalidates survivability estimates.

  **Deferred Cost Fallacy**  
  Costs postponed (deferred maintenance, externalized damage, unaccounted wear) are not costs avoided. Total capacity expenditure counts all costs when realized, regardless of immediate timing.

  **Over-Optimization Trap**  
  Commitment depth converts available Alpha into fixed obligations. Full commitment to a single configuration eliminates future optionality and constitutes Alpha depletion via over-commitment.

  **External Subsidy Misattribution**  
  Capacity supplied by an external system lies **outside** the system's own Alpha unless fully internalized. Reliance on external subsidy without attribution constitutes illusory Alpha; removal of subsidy reveals, rather than causes, Alpha collapse. (Flagged: Contains reference to Delta).

  Failure Condition
  **Alpha failure occurs when available capacity reaches zero.**
  Further existence or action is mechanically impossible. There is no partial failure state; at zero, continuation ends.

  Disconfirmation Signature (Kill Check)
  Constraint Alpha is false if a system can be shown to continue to exist and act indefinitely without any finite, exhaustible capacitystock whose depletion would terminate its existence.
