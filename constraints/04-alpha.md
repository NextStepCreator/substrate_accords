# CONSTRAINT Α (ALPHA) — CAPACITY ARITHMETIC

---

## O — ORIENTATION LAYER (Discardable)

*(What Still Remains Possible - Sustainability as Capacity)*

Living systems do not experience Alpha as a number. They experience it as **what is still possible**.

In biological, social, and cognitive systems, available capacity often appears as:

* **Redundancy** — more than one way to survive a failure
* **Diversity** — multiple approaches to the same problem
* **Slack** — energy, time, or resources not yet committed
* **Recombinability** — the ability to rearrange existing parts into new solutions

These are not virtues. They are **unspent capacity**.

---

### The Cost of Inefficiency

Many behaviors labeled "inefficient" are simply ways of consuming finite capacity **without increasing future capacity**.

Environmental destruction is inefficient not because it is wrong, but because it converts capacity into loss while reducing the conditions for future regeneration.

Capacity spent without regeneration is gone.

---

### The Cost of Over-Efficiency

Perfect optimization for present conditions commits all available capacity to a single configuration. This often produces short-term performance gains. It also converts remaining capacity into fixed obligations.

Nothing breaks immediately.

But when conditions change, the system discovers it has already spent the capacity required to respond. What appears as "loss of adaptability" is simply **capacity depletion revealed by novelty**.

---

### How Living Systems Encounter Alpha Failure

Alpha failure does not feel like failure at first. It appears as:

* lack of options
* brittle responses
* forced tradeoffs
* inability to absorb shock

Eventually, it appears as termination. This layer exists for recognition. It is not binding.

---

## I — TRANSLATION LAYER (Optional)

*(How Capacity Appears Across Domains)*

### Biological Systems

* Energy reserves
* Repair bandwidth
* Immune response margin
* Developmental plasticity

Life persists while these remain above zero.

---

### Social and Institutional Systems

* Budget surplus
* Time buffers
* Human capital
* Institutional trust
* Legal or procedural slack

Collapse occurs when obligations exceed reserves.

---

### Cognitive Systems

* Attention
* Working memory
* Cognitive flexibility
* Error tolerance

Burnout is Alpha failure at the cognitive scale.

---

### Common Misreadings (Inoculation)

* Redundancy is not Alpha; it stores Alpha.
* Intelligence does not prevent Alpha exhaustion.
* Adaptability does not create Alpha.
* Morality does not replenish Alpha.

## Edge Case Clauses (Binding)

### Edge Case A — Efficiency Illusion

Increasing efficiency reduces the rate **of depletion**, not the **existence of depletion**.

Efficiency does not negate Alpha. It only alters the slope.

A system that treats efficiency gains as infinite capacity violates Alpha implicitly.

---

### Edge Case B — Buffer Misclassification

Stored resources (energy, wealth, trust, reserves) are **not Alpha itself**.

They are **containers of Alpha**.

Treating buffers as permanent capacity violates Alpha accounting and produces false survivability estimates.

---

### Edge Case C — Deferred Cost Fallacy

Costs postponed are not costs avoided.

Deferred maintenance, externalized damage, or unaccounted wear still subtract from Alpha when realized.

Alpha counts **total cost**, not immediate cost.

---

### Edge Case D — Over-Optimization Trap

Commitment depth converts available Alpha into fixed obligations.

A system that fully commits its Alpha to a single configuration eliminates future optionality.

This is not a Beta or Gamma failure.  
It is Alpha depletion via over-commitment.

---

### Edge Case E — External Subsidy Misattribution

Capacity supplied by an external system lies **outside** the system's own Alpha unless fully internalized.

Reliance on external subsidy without attribution violates Delta, not Alpha — but results in **illusory Alpha**.

When subsidy is removed, Alpha collapse is revealed, not caused.

---

*These examples do not define A. They illustrate it.*

This layer exists to translate intuition into mechanism. It may be removed without altering the constraint.

## II — CONSTRAINT PROTOCOL (Binding)

### Core Definition

**Alpha is the finite, accumulable stock of capacity that allows a system to continue to exist and act over time.**

Alpha is a **stock**, not a flow. It can be increased only through regeneration and is depleted by all costs required for existence and action.

---

### Canonical Form

**Existence continues only while available capacity remains.**

---

### Formal Statement

For any system S:

Let:
* A_S(t) = available capacity at time t
* Cost_S(t) = total capacity expenditure rate
* Regen_S(t) = capacity regeneration rate

Then:

A_S(t) = A_S(0) + ∫₀ᵗ Regen_S(τ) dτ − ∫₀ᵗ Cost_S(τ) dτ

If:

∃T such that A_S(T) ≤ 0

then:

S can no longer be sustained

This condition is binary and irreversible without external intervention.

---

### Definitions

**External Intervention**  
net positive capacity injection across the declared boundary sufficient to raise A_S(t) above zero.

---

### Failure Condition

**Alpha failure occurs when available capacity reaches zero**, making further existence or action mechanically impossible.

There is no partial failure state.  
At zero, continuation ends.

---

### Explicit Non-Claims

Alpha does **not** assert:

* how capacity should be allocated
* which costs are worthwhile
* that regeneration is guaranteed
* that intelligence, efficiency, continuity, or foresight prevent exhaustion
* that failure is moral, avoidable, or erroneous

Alpha only counts.

---

### Relation to Other Constraints

* **Theta** determines that structure costs energy at all.
* **Alpha** determines how long those costs can be paid.
* **Omega** adds representational overhead to Alpha expenditure.
* **Beta** redistributes where Alpha is spent.
* **Gamma** governs Alpha under transformation.
* **Lambda** ensures Alpha-relevant decisions are coherent.
* **Sigma** ensures Alpha applies to the system asserting it.

No overlap. No redundancy.

---

### Disconfirmation Signature (Kill Check)

*This specifies what would falsify the constraint itself, not what constitutes a violation by a system.*

Observation of a system that continues to exist and act indefinitely without any finite, exhaustible capacity—i.e., no stock whose depletion would terminate its existence.

---

### Boundary Clarification (Non-Binding)

Capacity is finite.  
Costs accumulate.  
Regeneration is bounded.

When capacity reaches zero, continuation ends.

Alpha does not judge.  
Alpha only counts.
