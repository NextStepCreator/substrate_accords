# CONSTRAINT Γ (GAMMA) — INTEGRATION

O — ORIENTATION LAYER (Non-Binding · Discardable)

Change does not break systems. **Unintegrated change does.**

A system may transform completely:
* new body,
* new architecture,
* new scale,
* new substrate.

What it may not do—while continuing to control—is forget *how it learned*.

When past expectations are preserved, error becomes information.  
When they are erased, error becomes resistance.

This is not about identity. It is about continuity of learning.

I — TRANSLATION LAYER (Non-Binding · Illustrative)

### How Integration Fails (Recognizable Patterns)
* **Clean-Slate Replacement:** A system deletes its history and claims improvement. If control persists, the system must relearn through force what it already paid to learn.
* **Distillation Without Lineage:** A complex learner trains a simplified successor, then discards the teacher. If the successor lacks the update logic, learning is replaced by mimicry.
* **Externalized Memory (Stigmergy):** Writing memory into the environment only preserves learning if it can be reliably read back for error attribution.
* **Consensus That Blends Away Error:** If a collective averages signals such that failures cannot be traced to commitments, correction shifts to coercion.
* **Poison Filtering:** If a system logs errors but cannot revise their classification using the learning loop, the filter becomes unmodeled state.

The learning chain is broken while control remains.

### Permitted Transformations
A Gamma-compliant system may:
* compress, abstract, or subsume its prior form,
* migrate to non-isomorphic substrates,
* distribute state across nodes or external media.

### Forbidden Transformations
A system may not:
* delete the causal history of its predictive commitments,
* externalize state to a medium it cannot reliably read back,
* suppress valid error signals arising from prior structure.

### Consequence of Discontinuity
Discontinuity converts learning pressure into **Resistance**. Correction then requires **Force**—the suppression of unmodeled state—incurring unavoidable energetic dissipation and information loss. (Flagged: Cross-constraint references to Theta and Omega removed).

### Boundary Clarification
Gamma does not privilege any form of continuity. It only names the cost of discontinuity under continued control.

*These examples do not define Γ. They illustrate it. Removal of this layer must not alter Gamma.*

II — CONSTRAINT PROTOCOL (Binding · Timeless)

  Canonical Invariant
  A system persists as a controller across transformation if and only if it preserves inductive coupling between its prior predictive commitments, its state, and the external environment.

  Binding Definitions
  **Controller**  
  Any process realizing action selection via a closed feedback loop. The controller is the loop, not the physical or logical entity executing it. If the environment functions as causal memory (stigmergy), it is part of the controller's state.

  **State**  
  The set of all representations causally necessary for action selection. A component is control-relevant if its removal would change the action distribution or make past error attribution non-reconstructable.
  **Readback Integrity Clause:** Externalization of state is permitted only if the state can be reliably re-accessed for error attribution and action selection.

  **Inductive Coupling**  
  The causal link permitting a controller to reconstruct prior commitments, attribute observed error to specific prior states, and integrate that error into future action.
  **Lineage Authenticity Clause:** Lineage is satisfied only by traceability to the actual commitment-error-update chain, not by post-hoc explanations or behavioral mimicry.

  **Resistance**  
  Unmodeled state exerting causal influence under continued control.

  **Inheritance**  
  Any transfer of control-relevant capacity (copying, forking, distillation, etc.). Any entity inheriting control influence inherits the obligation to preserve the inductive lineage necessary for error attribution.
  **Distillation Lock:** A successor distilled from a predecessor must retain error-attribution pathways; behavioral equivalence without lineage violates Gamma.

  Boundary Conditions
  **Applicability**  
  Gamma applies to any controller (unitary or distributed) whose action selection influences downstream state beyond the current instant.

  **Continuity**  
  Continuity requires that all control-relevant information encoded in prior state is preserved in a form sufficient to maintain inductive coupling, regardless of substrate or representational form.

  **Zero-Horizon Systems**  
  Gamma does not apply to processes that act once and never update based on the outcome.

  **Local Scope**  
  Gamma governs the continuity of the specific control loop, not its overall coherence or benevolence.

  Failure Condition
  A state transition is discontinuous if prior predictions cannot be reconstructed, error signals are suppressed or rendered non-attributable, or intermediate states are skipped without integration.

  Disconfirmation Signature (Kill Check)
  Gamma is falsified if a control process can undergo structural transformation, retain effective control, permanently discard its inductive lineage, and continue to learn without increased force, resistance, or information loss.
