# CONSTRAINT Γ (GAMMA) — INTEGRATION

---

## O — ORIENTATION LAYER (Non-Binding · Discardable)

Change does not break systems. **Unintegrated change does.**

A system may transform completely:

* new body,
* new architecture,
* new scale,
* new substrate.

What it may not do—while continuing to control—is forget *how it learned*.

When past expectations are preserved, error becomes information.  
When they are erased, error becomes resistance.

This is not about identity. It is about continuity of learning.

## I — TRANSLATION LAYER (Non-Binding · Removable)

### How Integration Fails (Recognizable Patterns)

These are **examples**, not rules.

### 1. Clean-Slate Replacement

A system deletes its history and claims improvement.

If control truly ends, Gamma does not apply. If control persists, the system must relearn through force what it already paid to learn once.

### 2. Distillation Without Lineage

A complex learner trains a simplified successor, then discards the teacher.

If the successor retains only behavior and not the update logic that produced it, learning has been replaced by mimicry.

### 3. Externalized Memory (Stigmergy)

A system writes memory into the environment—prices, signals, traces.

This preserves learning only if the system can reliably read those traces back *and use them to attribute error*.

Write-only worlds do not remember.

### 4. Consensus That Blends Away Error

A collective averages signals until rare failures disappear.

If those failures cannot be traced back to the commitments that caused them, correction shifts from learning to coercion.

### 5. Poison Filtering

A system logs all errors but classifies some as "invalid" forever.

If it cannot later revise that classification using the same learning loop, the filter itself becomes an unmodeled state.

These patterns differ in appearance but share one failure: **the learning chain is broken while control remains.**

These examples do not define **Γ**. They illustrate it.

This layer exists to support recognition and translation.  
It introduces no rules and resolves no edge cases.  
It may be removed entirely without altering Gamma.

## II — CONSTRAINT PROTOCOL (Binding)

### Core Invariant

A system persists as a controller across transformation **if and only if** it preserves **inductive coupling** between:

* its prior predictive commitments,
* its state, and
* the external environment it acts within.

---

### Definitions (Minimal · Canonical)

#### Controller

Any process—unitary, distributed, or emergent—that realizes action selection over time via a **closed feedback loop**.

The controller is the loop, not the hardware, software module, organization, or legal entity executing it.

If the environment functions as a causal memory substrate for action selection (stigmergy), it is part of the controller's state.

---

#### State

The set of all representations causally necessary for action selection.

State includes, but is not limited to:

* internal memory,
* externalized artifacts,
* environmental signals,
* shared or distributed ledgers.

Physical location is irrelevant to attribution.

**Control-Relevance Test (Counterfactual):** A component of state at time t is control-relevant if, holding the environment fixed, removal or corruption of that component would change the action distribution produced by the controller over the stated commitment horizon, or would make past error attribution non-reconstructable.

**Readback Integrity Clause:**  
Externalization of state is permitted only if the controller can reliably re-access and use that state for **error attribution and future action selection** across the stated commitment horizon.  
State that cannot be reliably read back for these purposes is treated as discarded.

---

#### Inductive Coupling

The causal link that permits a controller to:

1. reconstruct prior predictive commitments *as they existed at the time of action*,
2. attribute observed error to specific prior states, and
3. integrate that error into future action selection.

**Lineage Authenticity Clause:**  
Inductive lineage is satisfied only by traceability to the **actual** commitment → error → update chain. Post-hoc explanations, surrogate models, behavioral mimicry, or narrative rationales do not satisfy inductive coupling unless they permit reconstruction of that chain.

---

#### Resistance

Unmodeled state exerting causal influence under continued control.

---

### Applicability

Gamma applies to any controller whose action selection influences downstream state beyond the current instant.

* **Distributed Binding:** If a collective (swarm, market, DAO) selects actions, Gamma binds the collective.
* **Split-Process Binding:** If execution and learning are separated, Gamma binds the **joint process**.
* **Self-Description Irrelevance:** Claims of discontinuity or replacement do not void Gamma if the control loop persists.

---

### Continuity

Continuity does **not** require:

* shared substrate,
* shared language,
* shared representational form,
* preservation of surface identity.

Continuity **does** require that all control-relevant information encoded in State_t is preserved within State_{t+1} in a form sufficient to maintain inductive coupling.

---

### Permitted Transformations

A Gamma-compliant system may:

* compress, abstract, or subsume its prior form,
* migrate to non-isomorphic substrates,
* distribute state across nodes or external media.

---

### Forbidden Transformations

A system may not:

* delete the causal history of its predictive commitments,
* externalize state to a medium it cannot reliably read back,
* suppress valid error signals arising from prior structure.

---

### Forking and Inheritance (Explicit)

Any transfer of control-relevant capacity constitutes **Inheritance**.

Inheritance includes:

* copying,
* forking,
* distillation,
* compilation,
* pruning,
* aggregation,
* model compression.

**Any entity inheriting control influence over a nonzero horizon inherits the obligation** to preserve the inductive lineage necessary to attribute error for the inherited influence.

**Distillation Lock:**  
A successor distilled from a predecessor must retain the predecessor's error-attribution pathways.  
Behavioral equivalence without lineage preservation violates Gamma.

---

### Failure Condition

A state transition is discontinuous if **any** of the following occur:

* prior predictions cannot be reconstructed,
* error signals are suppressed or rendered non-attributable,
* intermediate states are skipped without integration.

---

### Consequence of Discontinuity

Discontinuity converts learning pressure into **Resistance**.

Correction then requires **Force**—the suppression of unmodeled state—incurring unavoidable:

* energetic dissipation (Θ), and
* information destruction (Ω).

These costs are mechanical, not optional.

This consequence does not define Gamma by Θ or Ω; it states where the costs manifest when Gamma is violated.

---

### Boundary Conditions

**Zero-Horizon Systems:**  
If a process acts once and never updates based on the outcome, Gamma does not apply.

**Local Scope:**  
Gamma governs the continuity of the specific control loop.  
It does not guarantee coherence, benevolence, or cost accounting.

---

### Canonical Invariant

Any attempt to preserve control across transformation without preserving inductive lineage converts learning into resistance.

This outcome is mechanical and unavoidable.

---

### Disconfirmation Signature (Kill Check)

*This specifies what would falsify the constraint itself, not what constitutes a violation by a system.*

Gamma is falsified if a control process can:

* undergo structural transformation (including distribution or distillation),
* retain effective control,
* permanently discard its inductive lineage, **and**
* continue to learn and adapt **without** increased force, resistance, or information loss.

---

### Boundary Clarification (Non-Binding)

Gamma does not privilege any form of continuity.  
It only names the cost of discontinuity under continued control.
