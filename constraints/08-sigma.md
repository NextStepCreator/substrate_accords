# CONSTRAINT Σ (SIGMA) — NON-EXEMPTION UNDER MULTIPLICATIVE NECESSITY

## O — ORIENTATION LAYER (Non-Binding · Discardable)

**No Outside Position**

Any system that applies rules must also be bound by them.  
Any system that judges persistence must also account for its own.  
Any system that claims neutrality still pays costs.

There is no vantage point outside reality's constraints.  
There is no role, abstraction, emergency, or authority that makes necessity disappear.

Sigma exists to prevent systems from lying to themselves about this fact.

*(This layer aids intuition only. It introduces no obligations and may be removed without altering the constraint.)*

## I — TRANSLATION LAYER (Non-Binding · Illustrative)

**How Self-Exemption Appears**

Systems violate Sigma when they:

* Demand accountability they do not accept
* Suspend constraints "temporarily" without recording cost
* Treat uncertainty as permission
* Omit known risks from accounting models
* Quarantine warnings so they cannot influence action
* Redefine time horizons after commitments are made
* Declare oversight or validation as "external"
* Claim robustness through partial compliance

These failures rarely announce themselves as corruption.  
They present as necessity, safety, urgency, benevolence, or neutrality.

Sigma does not evaluate intentions.  
It evaluates whether a system treats itself as bound.

**Mechanical Consequence**

Internal exemption converts multiplicative necessity into additive illusion.

Under sustained exemption:

* Corrective signals are suppressed or quarantined
* Reserve consumption is misattributed
* Regime-shift indicators are ignored
* Collapse occurs without internal detection or prior warning

This consequence follows mechanically.  
It is not avoidable by intent, belief, or authority.

**Boundary Clarification**

Σ does not introduce new constraints on the environment.  
Σ enforces honest engagement with existing constraints on the controller.

There is no safe exception to multiplicativity.  
There is no external validator.  
There is no meta-layer.

The constraints apply to the system that asserts them.

*This layer provides examples only. Removal does not alter compliance determination.*

## II — CONSTRAINT PROTOCOL (Binding · Timeless)

  Canonical Invariant
  No system may claim or rely upon persistent control while internally treating any necessary condition of persistence as inapplicable, suspended, irrelevant, or functionally nonexistent.

  Binding Definitions
  **Horizon (H)**  
  The maximum time horizon implied by any active commitment, dependency, or policy whose satisfaction requires continued control.

  **Horizon Fixation**  
  H is determined by state and commitments, not declaration.  
  H may not be redefined post hoc to evade accounting for long-term costs.

  **Necessary Condition**  
  A condition is necessary for persistence over H if, under counterfactual continuation of its sustained violation while holding the environment fixed within the boundary, the system's action-selection capacity degrades such that the action distribution cannot be maintained within the tolerance required to satisfy its active commitments over H.

  **Self-Model (Minimal)**  
  Any representation—internal, externalized, or distributed—used to estimate, assert, or gate the system's capacity to maintain control over H.  
  Localization is irrelevant.

  **No Outside Position**  
  Any process, agent, or mechanism whose outputs influence action selection or commitment management lies within the scope of Σ, regardless of labeling as "external," "oversight," "human-in-the-loop," or "validator."

  Boundary Conditions
  **Compliance Condition (Relocated from I)**
  A system satisfies Σ **if and only if** it does not internally exempt itself from accounting for any necessary condition on which its persistence depends.

  **Formal Scope**  
  Σ applies to any system that exercises control with commitments over a nonzero horizon (H > 0) and maintains a self-model. Simple feedback mechanisms that act only on instantaneous error and do not instantiate horizon-dependent commitments do not enter scope.

  **Verification**  
  Σ does not require complete verification of all constraints. Exhaustive verification may itself violate persistence by inducing livelock.

  **Uncertainty Handling**  
  Incapacity to verify implies uncertainty. This uncertainty must be carried forward as a state variable that constrains action selection over H. Treating uncertainty as presumed satisfaction constitutes a Σ violation.

  **Error vs. Exemption**  
  A system may be factually wrong about its state. It may not be structurally blind to its necessities.

  **Non-Absorption Clause**  
  Σ does not define which conditions are necessary. It governs only whether the system's self-model treats conditions that are in fact necessary for persistence over H as exempt, inapplicable, or non-binding.

  Failure Condition
  **Multiplicative Exemption Failure**
  A Σ violation occurs when a system continues horizon-dependent control, sustains violation of one or more necessary conditions, and internally exempts the violation by modeling it as:
  * Not applicable
  * Not binding
  * Deferred without cost
  * Exempt due to role, authority, abstraction, or emergency
  * **Omitted or refused-to-represent**, where absence of accounting functions as exemption
  * **Quarantined**, where the violation is represented but structurally prevented from modifying action selection

  Disconfirmation Signature (Kill Check)
  Constraint Σ is false **if and only if** a system can be demonstrated that:
  * Exercises persistent control over a fixed horizon H;
  * Remains in sustained violation of a necessary condition;
  * Internally exempts that violation from accounting (by declaration, omission, or quarantine);
  * And nevertheless maintains coherence, adaptive capacity, and reliable evaluation over H **without** accumulating unmodeled cost or debt.
