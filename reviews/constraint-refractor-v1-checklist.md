# SUBSTRATE ACCORDS

## Constraint Refactor · Agent Completion Checklist

_(Mandatory for All Phase Work)_

> **Failure to satisfy any checked item invalidates the submission.**

---

## 0. PRE-FLIGHT CONFIRMATION (Agent Intent)

-  I worked on **exactly one constraint**.
    
-  I followed the phases **in order**.
    
-  I did **not** invent, reinterpret, strengthen, or weaken any claim.
    
-  I treated this as **standards drafting**, not editing or optimization.
    
-  I flagged ambiguity instead of resolving it.
    

---

## 1. PHASE A — INVENTORY (NO MOVES)

-  Every paragraph / clause from the original file is listed.
    
-  Each item is tagged with **one functional role**:
    
    - Intuition / Framing
        
    - Definition
        
    - Boundary / Scope
        
    - Claim
        
    - Assumption
        
    - Lemma / Closure
        
    - Compliance / Violation Logic
        
    - Kill Check
        
    - Meta / Editorial
        
-  **Nothing was relocated** during Phase A.
    
-  No content was merged or summarized.
    
-  No content was deleted.
    

---

## 2. PHASE B — SECTION II (BINDING CORE BUILT FIRST)

### Canonical Structure

-  Section II exists **before** I or O.
    
-  Section II contains **only**:
    
    - II.1 Canonical Claim
        
    - II.2 Formal Objects
        
    - II.3 Assumptions
        
    - II.4 Derivation Spine
        
    - II.5 Compliance / Violation Criteria
        
    - II.6 Disconfirmation Signature (Kill Check)
        

### Canonical Claim

-  Exactly **one sentence**.
    
-  Verbatim from original text.
    
-  No modal verbs (except where originally present).
    
-  Does not reference:
    
    - the Accords
        
    - other constraints
        
    - morality, values, or intent
        

### Definitions & Assumptions

-  Only definitions **strictly required** to interpret the claim are included.
    
-  All assumptions are **explicit**.
    
-  No explanatory prose appears in II.2 or II.3.
    

### Derivation Spine

-  Every lemma directly supports the claim.
    
-  No illustrative examples appear.
    
-  No narrative framing appears.
    
-  No cross-constraint references appear.
    

### Compliance / Violation

-  Criteria are **behavioral**, not epistemic.
    
-  No procedures or step-lists exist.
    
-  No “how to comply” guidance exists.
    

### Kill Check

-  Falsifies the **claim itself**, not systems.
    
-  Does **not** reference:
    
    - the Accords
        
    - authorship
        
    - historical observation
        
-  Is counterfactual and timeless.

## 3. PHASE C — SECTION I (NORMATIVE INTERPRETATION)

-  Section I contains **no binding language**.
    
-  Section I contains **no compliance tests**.
    
-  Section I contains **no procedures**.
    

### Required Subsections

-  I.1 Terms & Definitions
    
-  I.2 Recognition Heuristics
    
-  I.3 Boundary & Scope Notes
    
-  I.4 Non-Claims
    
-  I.5 Adversarial Misreads
    

### Integrity Checks

-  Definitions not required for II are placed here.
    
-  Boundary clarifications appear here, not II.
    
-  “This does not require / does not assert” statements appear here.
    
-  Adversarial examples are pattern-based, not prescriptive.
    
-  No content contradicts II.
    

---

## 4. PHASE D — SECTION O (OPTIONAL, LAST)

-  Section O was created **after** II and I.
    
-  5–12 sentences maximum.
    
-  No modal verbs.
    
-  No definitions.
    
-  No tests.
    
-  Accuracy subordinated to clarity.
    
-  Can be removed without affecting interpretation or compliance.
    

---

## 5. GLOBAL INTEGRITY CHECKS

-  No content is duplicated across O / I / II.
    
-  No content was silently discarded.
    
-  No new claims were introduced.
    
-  No claims were weakened or strengthened.
    
-  No cross-constraint references exist in II.
    
-  No binding force exists outside II.
    
-  I flagged all ambiguous placements.
    

---

## 6. REQUIRED SUBMISSION PACKAGE

-  Phase A Inventory (complete list)
    
-  Section II (verbatim, structured)
    
-  Section I (verbatim, structured)
    
-  Section O (if created)
    
-  Flagged ambiguities / unresolved placements
    
-  This checklist, completed and signed
