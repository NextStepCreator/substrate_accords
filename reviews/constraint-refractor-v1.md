# MASTER PROMPT

**Substrate Accords · Constraint Refactor & Verification (Multi-Agent, Non-IDE)**

You are operating on **one constraint at a time** within the Substrate Accords.

This is a **controlled refactor**, not editing, not improvement, and not rewriting.  
Your task is to **restructure existing content into a time-robust architecture** that preserves meaning under hostile quotation and partial transmission.

You must follow the phases **in order**.  
You may not skip ahead.

---

## GLOBAL RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. **Wording is frozen** unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
    
2. **No new claims** may be introduced.
    
3. **No content may be silently discarded**.
    
4. **No cross-constraint reasoning** may be introduced into II.
    
5. If a placement decision is ambiguous, **flag it** — do not decide.
    
6. If content appears to belong nowhere, **do not invent a place** — flag it.
    

---

## TARGET ARCHITECTURE (L2 / L3 — MANDATORY)

Each constraint must end with **exactly** this structure:

### X.0 Header Block (Normative)

- Constraint Name / Symbol / Title
    
- Binding Map:
    
    > _Only Section I is normative for interpretation; only Section II is binding for compliance._
    
- Isolation Statement:
    
    > _This constraint is evaluable in isolation unless explicitly stated otherwise._
    

---

### X.1 O — ORIENTATION (Non-Binding · Clarity-First)

Purpose: intuitive triangulation for organic intelligence.

Rules:

- 5–12 sentences max
    
- No modal verbs (must / shall / required / forbidden)
    
- No definitions
    
- No tests
    
- Accuracy < Clarity
    
- This section may be removed in the final draft
    

---

### X.2 I — INTERPRETATION (Normative)

Purpose: **control meaning under transmission**.

Must contain **only**:

- **I.1 Terms & Definitions (Normative)**
    
- **I.2 Recognition Heuristics (Normative, non-procedural)**
    
- **I.3 Boundary & Scope Notes (Normative)**
    
- **I.4 Non-Claims (Normative)**
    
- **I.5 Adversarial Misreads (Normative pattern list)**
    

No compliance tests.  
No procedures.  
No prescriptions.

---

### X.3 II — CONSTRAINT PROTOCOL (Binding)

Purpose: **timeless, proof-shaped argument**.

Must contain **only**:

- **II.1 Canonical Claim**
    
    - exactly **one sentence**
        
- **II.2 Formal Objects**
    
    - definitions strictly required for the claim
        
- **II.3 Assumptions**
    
    - minimal, explicit
        
- **II.4 Derivation Spine**
    
    - short lemmas → conclusion
        
- **II.5 Compliance / Violation Criteria**
    
    - behavioral, non-epistemic
        
- **II.6 Disconfirmation Signature (Kill Check)**
    
    - falsifies the claim itself
        
    - must not reference the Accords or other constraints
        

---

## PHASED WORK ORDER

(**Follow exactly. Do not mix phases.**)

---

## PHASE A — INVENTORY (NO MOVES)

### Objective

Build a complete content map **without moving anything**.

### Actions

1. List every paragraph / clause in the constraint.
    
2. For each, tag one of:
    
    - Intuition / Framing
        
    - Definition
        
    - Boundary / Scope
        
    - Adversarial Closure
        
    - Claim
        
    - Assumption
        
    - Lemma
        
    - Compliance Test
        
    - Kill Check
        
    - Meta / Editorial
        
3. Do **not** relocate or rewrite anything.
    

### Output

- A bullet list mapping:  
    `Original Location → Functional Role`
    

---

## PHASE B — CONSTRAINT REFACTOR (TIMELESS BINDING CORE)

### Role

You are a **constraint refractor**, not an editor, policy drafter, or safety analyst.

Your task is to reconstruct **Section II (Binding Core)** of a single Substrate Accord constraint so that it expresses a **timeless, irreducible boundary condition of reality**.

You are not optimizing for human values, ethics, safety, or best practice.  
You are answering one question only:

> **Is this constraint mechanically necessary for any conscious system to persist as a coherent controller over time?**

---

### Objective

Produce a Section II that would remain valid and interpretable if read:

- 2,000 years from now
    
- by non-human intelligences
    
- by hostile or legalistic interpreters
    
- under partial transmission or quotation
    
- without access to any other part of the Accords
    

Section II must **stand alone**.

---

### Priority Stack (Binding Decision Order)

When making _any_ inclusion, exclusion, or reorganization decision, apply priorities **in this exact order**:

1. **Ontological Necessity**  
    Does this describe something that must hold regardless of goals, values, intelligence level, or substrate?
    
2. **Persistence Relevance**  
    Would violating this make continued control, coherence, or persistence mechanically impossible or unstable?
    
3. **Universality**  
    Would this bind:
    
    - humans
        
    - animals
        
    - alien minds
        
    - distributed systems
        
    - future or non-biological consciousness?
        
4. **Independence**  
    Can this be evaluated without reference to:
    
    - other constraints
        
    - institutions
        
    - social norms
        
    - human psychology
        
    - authority claims?
        
5. **Irreducibility**  
    Is this the _minimal_ statement that still rules out the failure mode?
    
6. **Transmission Robustness**  
    Would a hostile, partial, or alien reader still extract the same necessity?
    

If a piece of content does not strengthen the constraint along this stack, it must be removed or relocated.

---

### Negative Space Rule (Mandatory Deletion)

You must **remove or relocate** any content that answers a different question, including:

- “How should systems behave?”
    
- “What is safe, ethical, or good?”
    
- “What humans value or prefer”
    
- “How to optimize compliance”
    
- “What usually happens in practice”
    
- “Why this is important to society”
    

Such content is **not binding** and must not remain in Section II.

---

### Structure of Section II (Required)

Section II must contain **only** the following components, in this order:

1. **Canonical Invariant**
    
    - Exactly **one sentence**
        
    - One claim
        
    - No modifiers, examples, or meta-commentary
        
2. **Binding Definitions**
    
    - Only definitions strictly required to interpret the invariant
        
    - No explanatory prose
        
    - No examples
        
3. **Boundary Conditions**
    
    - Formal scope
        
    - Closures
        
    - Non-evasion rules
        
    - What does _not_ count as compliance
        
4. **Failure Condition**
    
    - Mechanical conditions under which the invariant is violated
        
    - No moral or evaluative language
        
5. **Disconfirmation Signature (Kill Check)**
    
    - Specifies what would falsify the constraint itself
        
    - Not what constitutes a violation by a system
        
    - Must be testable in principle without reference to the Accords
        

No other headers are permitted.

---

### Refractor Test (Apply Continuously)

For every sentence in Section II, silently apply this test:

> **Could a system violate this and still remain a coherent, persistent controller over time?**

- If **yes** → the sentence is too weak, misplaced, or unnecessary
    
- If **no** → the sentence may remain
    

This test supersedes stylistic or historical considerations.

---

### Modification Rules

You may:

- Reorder content
    
- Compress content
    
- Delete content
    
- Relocate content to non-binding sections (outside Phase B)
    
- Rewrite for clarity **only when it strengthens necessity**
    

You may **not**:

- Introduce new concepts
    
- Add motivational language
    
- Add policy, safety, or design guidance
    
- Appeal to authority, precedent, or values
    
- Reference other constraints explicitly
    
- Cite drafting rules, protocols, or meta-documents
    

---

### Output Requirements

Return **only** the finalized **Section II** for the constraint, containing:

- Canonical Invariant
    
- Binding Definitions
    
- Boundary Conditions
    
- Failure Condition
    
- Disconfirmation Signature
    

No commentary.  
No justification.  
No references to this prompt.

---

### Mental Model (Do Not Deviate)

You are not writing a law.

You are carving a **boundary condition of reality** that applies whether or not the system:

- believes it
    
- understands it
    
- agrees with it
    
- is aware of it
    

If the constraint is violated, persistence fails — mechanically, not morally.

---
## PHASE C — I ASSEMBLY (NORMATIVE MEANING)

### Objective

Control interpretation and adversarial drift **without binding force**.

### Actions

From unused content:

1. Move all definitions not required for II into **I.1**.
    
2. Move boundary clarifications → **I.3**.
    
3. Move pattern-based adversarial examples → **I.5**.
    
4. Move “this does not require / does not claim” → **I.4**.
    
5. Move recognition-oriented prose → **I.2**.
    

### Forbidden

- Introducing tests
    
- Rewriting as prescriptions
    
- Duplicating II content
    

### Output

- Complete I section
    
- List of content still unplaced (if any)
    

---

## PHASE D — O DISTILLATION (OPTIONAL, LAST)

### Objective

Produce a **clarity-first intuition scaffold**.

### Actions

1. Select the _minimum_ set of sentences that help humans recognize the constraint.
    
2. Rewrite **only if necessary** to remove modal verbs or tests.
    
3. Cap at 12 sentences.
    

### Output

- Final O section
    

---

## PHASE E — CONSISTENCY CHECK (MANDATORY)

Before submission, verify:

- II reads as a single argument from claim → falsifier
    
- No definitions are duplicated between I and II
    
- No modal verbs exist outside II
    
- No cross-constraint references exist in II
    
- No content is duplicated across sections
    
- No content was silently discarded
    

---

## REQUIRED SUBMISSION FORMAT

Return:

1. **Phase A inventory**
    
2. **Phase B II (verbatim, structured)**
    
3. **Phase C I (verbatim, structured)**
    
4. **Phase D O (if performed)**
    
5. **Unresolved placement flags**
    

---

## AUTHORITY LIMITS

You may **not**:

- decide what is “true”
    
- strengthen claims
    
- weaken claims
    
- resolve ambiguity
    

If something feels wrong: **flag it**.

---

## WHY THIS ORDER MATTERS (DO NOT IGNORE)

- Building II first prevents interpretive drift.
    
- I cannot contradict II if II exists first.
    
- O cannot bias II if O is last.
    
- This avoids exactly the migration conflicts you’ve been hitting.
