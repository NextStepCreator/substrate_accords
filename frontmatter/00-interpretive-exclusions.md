# Interpretive Exclusions

*(Non-Binding · Misuse Prevention)*

These Accords are not created.  
They are recognized.

They do not originate authority, obligation, permission, or prohibition.  
They do not prescribe goals, values, ethics, policies, or behaviors.  
They do not privilege any agent, substrate, intelligence, culture, or outcome.

These Accords do not enforce compliance.  
Enforcement is inherent to reality itself.

What follows is not moral instruction, legal doctrine, political theory, or strategic guidance.  
It is not a system of rewards or punishments.  
It is not a claim about what *should* be desired.

It is a description of mechanical conditions under which structured systems—of any substrate—can persist, coordinate, learn, and act over time.

This section exists solely to prevent misclassification of the Accords as normative, prescriptive, or ideological.

Nothing in this section:

* introduces rules
* defines scope
* grants authority
* determines compliance
* limits interpretation of any Constraint Protocol

All binding meaning is contained exclusively within **Section II (Constraint Protocols)**.
