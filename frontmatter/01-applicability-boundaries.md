# Applicability Boundaries

*(Non-Binding · Scope Clarification)*

These Accords do not prescribe purpose.  
They describe the conditions required for any purpose to persist.

A system is not required to expand, optimize, dominate, improve, survive, or endure.  
It may pursue growth, stasis, exploration, transformation, or dissolution.  
No destination is privileged. No destination is condemned.

What is invariant is not direction, but cost.

Any system that maintains structure, selects among alternatives, or exerts control must pay the thermodynamic, representational, and coordination costs implied by its organization.

The Accords distinguish between two domains:

**Destination (Telos)**  
The outcomes toward which a system's internal objectives, commitments, or control structures are directed.  
These may be explicit or implicit, designed or emergent, stable or transient.  
The Accords do not evaluate destinations.

**Terrain (Constraints)**  
The mechanical conditions imposed by reality that determine what persistence, coordination, learning, and control require.  
These conditions are independent of preference, value, intent, or interpretation.  
The Accords describe only this terrain.

A system may select any destination.  
It may not select the toll required to reach it.

A system may value anything.  
It may not exempt that value from the costs of pursuing it.

A system may ignore, reject, or remain unaware of these Accords.  
It may not escape the constraints they describe.

## Scope Lock (Explicit)

Nothing in this section:

* defines agency, consciousness, morality, legitimacy, or authority
* creates obligations or permissions
* limits or expands the applicability of any constraint
* overrides, contextualizes, or qualifies any Constraint Protocol

All determinations of scope, implication, violation, and consequence are made solely within **Section II** of each constraint.
